<!--You will create a single web page
for a fake company.
Use HTML and CSS to fully style
it using modern design trends and
page layout. Use JavaScript to
create a modal to appear after a
given amount of time on the page.
You will need to fully style the
modal too so think about what this
modal will be used for.
Is it a pop-up ad?
Is it a prompt to get the user to
enter their email address to sign up
for the company newsletter? Is it a
prompt to get the user to share this
page on Facebook?
You decide but make it look as
professional as possible.-->
